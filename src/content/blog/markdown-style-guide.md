If you're one of those geeks interested in coding interviews and jobs in big tech companies, you probably have heard about data structures before. Data structures are often implemented using classes or primitives in programming languages to organize and store data efficiently. They are fundamental concepts in computer science and are essential for solving complex problems efficiently. In this blog post, we will explore some of the most important data structures, their use cases, and how they can be implemented in Python. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, this post will provide you with a solid foundation to understand data structures and their role in computer science. So, let's dive in!
So first let's list all data structures we're going to discuss in this post:
- Arrays
- Linked Lists (Including doubly linked lists).
- Queue
- Stack
- Trees
- Graphs (Only basic stuff).
- Hash Tables.
- Heaps.
