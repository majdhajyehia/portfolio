If you're one of those geeks interested in coding interviews and jobs in big tech companies, you probably have heard about data structures before. Data structures are often implemented using classes or primitives in programming languages to organize and store data efficiently. They are fundamental concepts in computer science and are essential for solving complex problems efficiently. In this blog post, we will explore some of the most important data structures, their use cases, and how they can be implemented in Python. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, this post will provide you with a solid foundation to understand data structures and their role in computer science. So, let's dive in!
So first let's list all the data structures we're going to discuss in this post:
- Arrays
- Linked Lists (Including doubly linked lists).
- Queue
- Stack
- Trees
- Graphs (Only basic stuff).
- Hash Tables.
- Heaps.
# 1. Arrays
> In computer science, an array is a linear data structure that stores a collection of values, those values are typically of the same data type. In programming languages like `C#`, `C++`, `Java` or other programming languages arrays have a fixed size that is given to the compiler at compilation time, this size cannot be modified during Run-Time. Similarly, the data type of the values that the array can store is fixed at compilation and cannot be modified later. Arrays give us the ability to iterate over elements in a linear manner and access any values at any given index in an efficient way, the time at which we can access a value by its index is constant.
 Okay, now that we have defined arrays we will take a look at
